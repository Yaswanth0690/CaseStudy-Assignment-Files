My Case Study And Assignment Files



****For both Assignment And Case Study Files You need To Change The username,password From the file "propertyFilePath" add file path to DbpropertyUtil.java in util in each src folder and DB folder holds the tables with their respective names inside each file there are different names rows respectively.****



(NOTE:
I'm including Apache Ide made Assignment also there just open it goto src for cod editing etc but to just run It open dist folder and run rhe java file named Student_Information_System_(SIS)_
****need to connect to the db to work perfectly****
)
